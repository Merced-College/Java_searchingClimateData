# Java_searchingClimateData
Starter code and the data file for our project to practice merge sort, quicksort, and binary search.

Using some Climate Change Data found at https://data.world/data-society/global-climate-change-data/workspace/file?filename=GlobalLandTemperatures%2FGlobalLandTemperaturesByState.csv 

We will practice OOD, implementing advanced sorts, and testing our binary search algorithm.
***

We will use the given code to start. Then review how to load our data into our data structure implement quicksort and binary search to find things in our data TODO:

Implement mergesort to sort our data.  Ask the data 2 more questions, and make methods to implement the answer to the questions. Write the questions above the methods you make. Use the sorting and searching methods we/you made to sort and search the data to answer your question.

Interpret your results in the response to this assignment answer the questions in the README and listed below. 

Git push or reupload your project files to turn them into your cloned github repo --> the files I need to see our your main.cpp (whatever you named it), ClimateChangeRecord.cpp and ClimateChangeRecord.h, and the README with your unique answers.  
***

* Your code should implement both mergesort and quicksort for our objects, and be used at least one time each in main to sort the data.

* Your code should implement binary search, and use it when searching the data.

* You need to make at least 5 or more commits to this repo, so that I can see the development of your code.

Answer the following question, and add your answer to the README file in your repo:
1. Explain the results of ours, and your tests on the data; make at least 3 intelligent conclusions on why the results of the code are what they are. This answer should be at least 10+ sentences explaining the question you asked, the algorithm you wrote, and how that algorithm answers your question. You should include how you sorted and searched your data, and the time and space complexity the algorithm used.
